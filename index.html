    Coqrel: binary logical relations for Coq
  </h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Coqrel is a library for the Coq proof assistant
    which facilitates relational reasoning
    by mechanizing techniques associated with binary logical relations.
    It provides a unified language and methodology for
    building relations between complex objects,
    and an extensible tactic library for solving relational goals.
  </p>

  <h2>Documentation</h2>
  <p>
    I presented Coqrel at the CoqPL'15 workshop; an
    <a href="http://arthur.chargueraud.org/events/coqpl2016/CoqPL_2016_paper_7.pdf">extended abstract</a>
    is available.
  </p>
  <p>
    While additionnal documentation is scarce,
    the code is well-commented and should be reasonably easy to read.
    Coqrel uses the Coq's typeclass system extensively,
    both to make the system extensible by the user,
    and to enable full backtracking between the different components.
    As a result,
    some familiarity with the typeclass system of Coq
    will be valuable to understand the code.

    You can browse the Coqdoc
    <a href="html/toc.html">table of contents</a> and
    <a href="html/index.html">index</a> here.
    The top-level file
    <a href="html/coqrel.LogicalRelations.html">LogicalRelations</a>
    is a good place to start.
